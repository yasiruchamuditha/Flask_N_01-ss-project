# Flask_N_01-ss-project

The primary goal of this project is to establish a secure and confidential messaging platform. This project aims to develop a secure messaging system using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and the MD5 hashing algorithm.

ECC is a strong public-key encryption method known for its efficiency and security, while MD5 is a cryptographic hash function used to ensure data integrity. This project will involve implementing ECC for key generation and encryption, as well as MD5 hashing for password storage, and user registration with input validation. 

The system also enables role-based access control to handle diverse communication scenarios. Users will be able to send and receive messages securely using this system. The project will include the development of a Python-based application with a user-friendly interface for sending and receiving secure messages.
